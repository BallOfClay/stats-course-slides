\section{Conditional Probability}

%
\begin{frame}

Suppose we know that one event $C$ has already happened or will happen (the
condition), and we want to know the probability of different event $B$.

\hfill

Then the \textbf{conditional probability of $A$ given $B$} is defined by

$$ P(A \mid B) = \frac{\text{\# of ways A and B \textbf{both} happen}}{\text{\#
of ways B can happen}} $$

\end{frame}

When rolling two fair, six-sided dice, what is the conditional probability that Die One shows a 2, given that the sum of Die One and Die Two is less than or equal to 5?

\begin{align*}
P(\text{Die One} = 2   \mid \text{Die One} + \text{Die Two} \leq 5) = \\
= \frac{\text{\# of ways of Die One is 2 while total for both is 5 or less}}{\text{\# of ways of Die One and Die Two total 5 or less}}
\end{align*}

\end{frame}
%

%
\begin{frame}

$$\text{\#of ways of Die One is 2 while total for both is 5 or less} = 3 $$
$$ \text{\# of ways of Die One and Die Two totaling 5 or less} = 10 $$

\end{frame}
%

%
\begin{frame}

\begin{align*}
P(\text{Die One} = 2 \mid \text{Die One} + \text{Die Two} \leq 5) = \\
&= \frac{3}{10} \\
&= 0.3
\end{align*}

\end{frame}

There is another way to look at conditional probabilities

\begin{align*}
P(A & \mid B) & \\
%
&= \frac{\text{\# of ways A and B \textbf{both} happen}}{\text{\#
of ways B can happen}} \\[0.5ex]
%
&= \frac{\frac{\text{\# of ways A and B \textbf{both} happen}}{\text{Total \# of
things that can happen}}}{\frac{\text{\# of ways B can happen}}{\text{Total \# of
things that can happen}}} \\[0.5ex]
%
&= \frac{P(A \text{ and } B)}{P(B)}
\end{align*}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}

\begin{align*}
P(\text{Die One} = 2 \mid \text{Die One} + \text{Die Two} \leq 5) = \\
&= \frac{3/36}{10/36} \\
&= \frac{0.0833}{0.2778} \\
&= 0.3
\end{align*}

\end{frame}

What is the conditional probability that you draw a full house, given that you know you
have at least a three of a kind

\begin{align*}
P(\text{Drawing a} & \text{ straight flush} \mid \text{Drawing a straight}) = \\
%
&= \frac{\text{\# of ways of drawing straight flush}}{\text{\# of ways of drawing
a straight}} \\
%
&= \frac{ 10 \times 4 } { 10 \times 4 ^ 5} \\
%
&= \frac{40}{10240} \\
%
&= 0.0039
%
\end{align*}

\textbf{Important}: Any hand straight flush \textbf{automatically}
contains a straight, and we are including a royal flush as a type of straight flush!

What is the conditional probability that you draw a full house, given that you
have drawn a four of a kind.

What is the conditional probability that you draw a four of a kind, given that
you know you already have a pair?
