\section{Random Varaibles}

\begin{frame}
A random variable $X$ is an object that can be used to generate numbers, in a way that valid probabilistic statements about the generated numbers can be made. 

For example:
$$ P(X &gt; 0) = 0.5 $$
$$ P(-1 &lt; X &lt; 1) = 0.25 $$
$$ P(X &lt; 0) = 0 $$
$$ P(X &gt; 1 \mid X &gt; 0) = 0.5 $$

Are all probabilistic statements about an unknown random variable.

Random varaibles can be used to model real life events or measurements when
there is some varaiation in thier outcomes that we cannot account for

\begin{itemize}
\item The number of heads seen in ten flips of a quarter.
\item The number of heads seen in ten flips of a dime.
\item The number of Busses that arrive late to a stop in Seattle in a single
day.
\item The number of times my cat asks for food between 5 and 6 pm (when she is
always fed) in a given day.
\item The temperature on a mid-summers day in Seattle.
\item The rainfall in a mid-winters day in Seattle.
\end{item}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
We naturally have a feeling that there is something \textbf{the same} about
these two situations

\begin{itemize}
\item The number of heads seen in ten flips of a quarter.
\item The number of heads seen in ten flips of a dime.
\end{frame}

What is it?
\end{frame}
%

%
\begin{frame}

We expect that the probabilities

$$ P(\text{We get 5 heads in 10 flips of a quarter}) $$
$$ P(\text{We get 5 heads in 10 flips of a dime}) $$

are \textbf{equal}.

So are

$$ P(\text{We get 2 heads in 10 flips of a quarter}) $$
$$ P(\text{We get 2 heads in 10 flips of a dime}) $$

and so on...
\end{frame}
%

%
\begin{frame}
The \textbf{sameness} that we sense between

\begin{itemize}
\item The number of heads seen in ten flips of a quarter.
\item The number of heads seen in ten flips of a dime.
\end{frame}

is that the probabilities of all events like

$$ P(\text{We get } N \text{ heads in 10 flips of a quarter}) $$
$$ P(\text{We get } N \text{ heads in 10 flips of a dime}) $$

\textbf{are all equal}.
\end{frame}
%

\begin{frame}
We summarize this by saying that the random varaibles


\begin{itemize}
\item The number of heads seen in ten flips of a quarter.
\item The number of heads seen in ten flips of a dime.
\end{frame}

\textbf{have the same distribution}.

The \textbf{distribution} of a random varaible is the collection of all
probabilities we assign to all outcomes of the random varaible.
