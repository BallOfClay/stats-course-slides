# Probability and Stats Short Course

These materials are for the free Probability and Statistics short course taught at Galvanize Seattle.  This course is intended to discuss material that Galvanize data science instructors believe is foundational for successful students in the data science immersive program.

## Things You Should Bring

You should bring the following materials:

  - Notebook
  - Pencils and/or Pens

We will be pausing often to allow people to work through problems, and then discussing them as a class.  It is important that you attempt these problems, as this will give you a good foundation of practice when you move on to practicing on your own.
